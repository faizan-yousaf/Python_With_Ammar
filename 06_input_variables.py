    #We are learning about the basic Input functions
# fruit_basket= "Mangoes"
# print(fruit_basket)

    #Now Let's take 1 input from the user:
# fruit_basket=input("What is your favourite fruite? ")
# print("Your favourite fruite is ",fruit_basket)

    #let's take 2 inputs from our user:
# name = input("write your name: ")
# age = input ("enter your age here: ")
# print("Your name is : ", name ," \nYour age is : " , age)


    #  Let's use 3rd standard input function\
print("****Answer the following questions****")

name = input("what is your name? ")
age = input("what is your age? ")
address = input("what is your address? ")

print("****Your typed answers are: ****")

print("Hello ! Your name is: ", name)
print("Your age is: ", age)
