            #Strings!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


print("this is my first string!")

#there are 3 ways to write strings: (' '), (" "), (''' ''')

print('Hi there, My name is Faizan.')
print("Hi there, My name is Faizan.")
print('''Hi there, My name is Faizan.''')

#but what if:
# print('hi, what's up') This statement will generate an error!

#then use this: (" ")

print("hi, what's up?")

#or use this: (''' ''')
print('''hi, what's up? ''')
